    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This Homemade Pepperoni pizza has everything you want - a great crust, gooey cheese, and tons 
        of pepperoni. 
    </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li> 16 ounces pizza dough</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li> 18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li> 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
        <li> flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>    
    </ul> 
    <h3> Ingredients for Quick Pizza Sauce </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no sault)</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1/2 granulated garlic</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li><h4>Preheat the oven</h4> <p> Preheat oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza stone, 
            preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</p> </li>

        <li><h4>Make the sauce</h4> <p> If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients.
             The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily double it if you 
             are making more than one pizza.</p></li>

        <li><h4>Roll out the dough</h4> <p> Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. 
            If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. 
            For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</p></li>

        <li><h4>Add the toppings</h4> <p> Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. 
            Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron. Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza,
             leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle 
             it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. 
             Season with black pepper.</p></li>

        <li><h4>Cook the pizza</h4> <p> If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into 
            the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway 
            so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and 
            charred in spots. </p></li>

        <li><h4>Slice and serve</h4> <p> Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. 
            Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional).
            Serve while warm with a side salad.</p></li>
    </ol>
